# mtm Project

This project engaged in Graph calculator where you can build a graph including vertexes and edges, <br />
merge Graphs and do other manipulations.

All commands are executed through instructions you write inside an inner shell, whos also built in the program.


## How to use
you will have several commands wich you can use in order to use this GraphCalc

for Creating a new Graph  <be />
(for example with vertexes {x1, x2, x3} and the edges {<x1,x2>, <x2,x3>, <x3,x1>} ) :
```
<graph name> = {x1, x2, x3 | <x1,x2>, <x2,x3>, <x3,x1>}
```
Union <br />
this operand will union the vertexes Group and the Edges Group.
```
<Graph name1> + <Graph name2>
```
Intersection <be />
this operand will intesect the vertexes Group and the Edges Group.
```
<Graph name1> ^ <Graph name2>
```
Difference <be />
this operand will reduce the vertexes Group and the Edges Group from g1 to g2 respectively.
```
<Graph name1> - <Graph name2>
```
you shell see all the rest in the documantation.
